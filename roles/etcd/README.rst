======
 etcd
======
 
This role installs etcd from package and configures it for the tendrl project
based on `upstream tendrl documentation`_ and `tendrl demo presentation`_.

This role is still *a hack*, since the configuration is not fully documented
in the tendrl upstream so far, eg (ignoring general documentation issues):

* https://github.com/Tendrl/documentation/issues/63
* https://github.com/Tendrl/documentation/issues/61
